- remove system() and usleep() unistd.h calls
- better modularity 
- give it a proper build system (cmake maybe?)
- mayyybe bsd support? (no one uses that though (jkjk))
- because the main loop takes slightly more than a millisecond to complete, and usleep is called for 1000 milliseconds, the clock might occasionally skip a second
